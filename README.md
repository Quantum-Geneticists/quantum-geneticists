## Project description
We conducted the initial tests using a genetic approach to minimize the singlet probability by tuning the timing of the applied external magnetic field pulses. This approach was fine-tuned, similar to a hypervalidation setup, where different configurations were tested, and the best one was selected according to a given measure (the singlet probability), using a grid-search approach.
