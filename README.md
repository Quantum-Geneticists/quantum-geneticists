## Project description
We conducted some initial tests using a genetic approach for realising optimal quantum control of radical pair reactions. To that end the physically relevant quantities, namely the singlet probability and recombination yields, were minimised by tuning applied external magnetic field pulses to drive reaction outcomes. This approach was fine-tuned through to a hypervalidation setup, where different configurations were tested, and the best one was selected according to a given measure (the singlet probability), using a grid-search approach. To limited success, formulating a re-inforcement learning strategy was also attempted.
